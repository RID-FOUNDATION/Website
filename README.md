RID Foundation (Research and Ideas Development) is a non-governmental, non-profit, non-political, voluntary, and charitable organization dedicated to fostering education, health, and compassionate care for the elderly in Bangladesh. Registered under the Societies Registration Act, XXI of 1860, the Foundation was established with a vision to transform research and innovative ideas into real-world solutions that improve lives and strengthen communities.
At the heart of our mission lies a deep belief that education and health are the cornerstones of human dignity and sustainable development. We work to promote STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) and HEAL (Health, Education, Administration & Literacy) education across all levels—enhancing quality learning, encouraging scientific thinking, and nurturing creativity among young minds. Through our research-driven initiatives, RID Foundation strives to modernize curricula, promote digital learning, and establish model institutions that reflect international standards and inclusive values.
In the field of health, the Foundation is committed to ensuring access to standard healthcare services for all, especially for vulnerable groups such as women, children, and the elderly. We plan to establish model clinics, hospitals, and specialized centers dedicated to maternal and child health, preventive care, and community well-being. Our vision of health extends beyond treatment—it is about awareness, compassion, and empowerment.
Recognizing the growing need for elderly support, RID Foundation is establishing a long-term care and old age home to provide not just shelter, but dignity, comfort, and companionship for senior citizens. We believe that every elderly person deserves love, respect, and a safe environment to live their later years in peace.
Through our work, we aim to build a society where education enlightens, health empowers, and humanity embraces all ages. The RID Foundation continues to stand as a beacon of hope—driven by innovation, guided by compassion, and committed to creating a better tomorrow for all.
Beyond the domains above, our strategic roadmap includes initiatives in social business, cultural activities, agricultural programs, and the sustainable management of the environment and natural resources.
